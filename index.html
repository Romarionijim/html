	<b>A possible big 3 at the Clippers?
The Los Angeles Clippers can make a trade for LeMarcus Aldridge, which can give them a big 3 capable enough to take on just about anybody in the league. The Spurs are due for a rebuild, and if they decide to do so, they would want to move the 36 y/o LeMarcus Aldridge. In returns, the Clippers can send their center Ivica Zubac, Patrick Beverley, and a young player/draft pick which could suit the Spurs rebuild.</b>

	<b>Hornets waive Batum, headed to LA
Shams Charania: The Charlotte Hornets are waiving forward Nicolas Batum, sources tell The Athletic.<br> Batum plans to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers after he clears waivers. Multiple contenders made plans to pursue Batum once the Hornets made clear he could be waived. The Clippers are set to receive the versatile veteran forward.</b>

<b>This is the fifth time in seven seasons under coach Doc Rivers that the Clippers have lost a playoff matchup after holding a series lead at some point. The losses werenâ€™t necessarily equal. The first-round defeat against the Jazz in 2017, for instance, came after just a 2-1 edge. And the 2-0 lead they lost to Portland in the 2016 first round could be forgiven as stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul went down with injuries. But even setting those aside, the hard-luck Los Angeles club has given its fans an abundance of heartburn and nightmare fuel over the last seven years.</b>

	<hr><b>The Boston Celtics announced Tuesday that guard Kemba Walker received a stem-cell injection in his left knee in October and was placed on a 12-week strengthening program. 

The Celtics added that Walker will return to on-court activities in early December, and they will provide an update regarding his game availability in January's first week.

Since the 2020-21 season is set to begin Dec. 22, Walker will miss the start of the campaign.</b>

<b>Last season was his first in Boston after eight years with the Charlotte Hornets, and he averaged 20.4 points, 4.8 assists and 3.9 rebounds per game in 2019-20.
The four-time All-Star played an integral part in leading the Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals after a disappointing 49-33 finish in 2018-19, a year that ended with Boston losing in the conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.</b>
